### ‚ö† BREAKING CHANGES

- **deps:** The minimum required version of node is now v14.17.

  This is a maintenance release. An increasing amount of dependencies
  required a node version higher than the Node 10 version supported by
  `semantic-release@17`. We decided to go straight to a recent Node LTS
  version because the release build is usually independent of others,
  requiring a higher node version is less disruptive to users, but helps us
  reduce the maintenance overhead.

### üèóÔ∏è Builds System

- **deps:** update semantic-release monorepo ([#28](https://github.com/latipun7/library/issues/28)) [`05641c1`](https://github.com/latipun7/library/commit/05641c1bdbf00dfb650c152c2d88c48afcb2dfdb).
